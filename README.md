Object Oriented Programming 

## Description

The SVG Logo Maker Challenge was completed following the introduction to the Object Oriented Programming Paradigm. 

Completing this project allowed for further exploration into to the importance of the 'DRY' programming principles and the ways in which OOP can help developers achieve this. 

Some of the key learning topics include Class Contructors and Class Inheritance. 

The challenge also served as an introduction to Test Driven Development.
